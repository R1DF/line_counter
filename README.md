# Line Counter
Have you ever been curious to see how much code you wrote for one project? This simple script that will calculate exactly that/

# How it works
1. It asks you for the directory (folder) of your project.
2. It then finds every single directory inside the main project directory and asks you to exclude any you don't want.
3. It finds every possible file extension that is in the project and asks which types of files you want to count the lines of.
4. It iterates over every file and individually shows you how many lines have been written, and then gives you the sum.

# How do I get it?
Just download `line_counter.py`.<br>
If you don't have Python, check out the Releases section for an executable.
